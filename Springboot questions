A. Different bean scopes
 1. Singleton : The default scope in Spring Boot, where the Spring container creates and manages a single instance of a bean per Spring IoC container. This is memory efficient because the bean is reused across the application. 
 2. Prototype : The framework manages the type of bean, but creates a new instance of that class each time it's requested.
 3. Request : creates a bean instance for a single HTTP request.
 4. Session : creates a bean instance for an HTTP Session.
 5. Application : creates the bean instance for a ServletContext.
 6. websocket : creates it for a particular WebSocket session.

B. The three main types of dependency injection in Spring Boot are:
Constructor injection
The injector supplies the dependency through the client class constructor. This is the most recommended technique in the Spring Framework. 
Setter injection
The injector method injects the dependency to the setter method exposed by the client. This technique provides flexibility for changes at runtime. 
Field injection
The injector directly injects dependencies into class fields. This is a concise but potentially less flexible approach
