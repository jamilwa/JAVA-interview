A. Different bean scopes
 1. Singleton : The default scope in Spring Boot, where the Spring container creates and manages a single instance of a bean per Spring IoC container. This is memory efficient because the bean is reused across the application. 
 2. Prototype : The framework manages the type of bean, but creates a new instance of that class each time it's requested.
 3. Session
