1. what is context switching? 
    Context switching is a process that occurs in when the operating system (OS) switches the processor from executing one thread or process to another. This switch involves saving the state of the currently running thread or process so that it can be resumed later, and loading the state of the new thread or process to be executed next.
    context switching is a fundamental concept in operating systems that allows for multitasking, concurrency, and efficient CPU utilization by enabling the OS to switch between different threads or processes running on a system.
