1. Maybe<UserAddress> userAddress = address               // if blockingGet() is not used then it will return object of type Maybe<UserAddress>.

Error: The annotation @Autowired is disabled for this location
	Fix: @Autowired can't be used for local variable, you should add it outside method scope, as field
	Error: Failed to configure a datasource: 'url' attribute is not specified and no embedded datasource could be configured
	Fix: Correct your dependencies
	Error: web server failed to start. Port 8080 was already in use.
	Fix: Go to CMD and type the command netstat -a, you will get to know which process is running in port 8080. you can chagne the default port of your app in application.properties
	by adding following line: server.port=8090   or  kill the process which is using port 8080
	Steps to kill a process
	netstat -ano | findstr 8080
	taskkill /F /PID processIdNumber

	execute jar file by the command  java.exe -jar "lombok.jar"
3.  could not prepare statement [Table "PS1_0" not found; SQL statement:
	delete ps1_0 from PLM_SYNC_TB ps1_0 where ps1_0.Master_Item_ID=? and ps1_0.IS_SDS=? [42102-224]] [delete ps1_0 from PLM_SYNC_TB ps1_0 where ps1_0.Master_Item_ID=? and ps1_0.IS_SDS=?]; SQL [delete ps1_0 from PLM_SYNC_TB ps1_0 where ps1_0.Master_Item_ID=? and ps1_0.IS_SDS=?]
sol:  made below updates in the application-build.yml file 
		   datasource.url: jdbc:h2:mem:GIS_LANDING;MODE=MSSQLServer
		   jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect

4. migrating the springboot version and java version
sol:    make below updates in build.gradle file
		org.springframework.boot' version '3.4.1'
     		implementation group: 'org.springdoc', name: 'springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui', version: '2.7.0'
     		java 17
	make below updates in properties.gradle file
		springCloudVersion = '2024.0.0'

5. if using jfrog and other authentication and while setting up project locally you are unable to run the project and get the below error
	
	ERROR: Server returned HTTP response code: 401 for URL: https://gapinc.jfrog.io/gapinc/generic-repo/gradle-8.6-bin.zip
	
SOL:	then make following changes
	To gradle services locally make following changes in the repo

	1. wrapper.properties
	distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.6-bin.zip

	2. build.gradle
		//	username = System.getenv('SAAS_ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME')
		//	password = System.getenv('SAAS_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD')
			username = "jmohamm"
			password = ""        // this is generated from jfrog as API key
				
	3. properties.gradle
		//        username System.getenv('SAAS_ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME') ?: "$saas_artifactory_username"
		//        password System.getenv('SAAS_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD') ?: "$saas_artifactory_password"
        		  username "jmohamm"
        		  password ""  		// this is generated from jfrog as API key
    
			
6. APIs and deployment 
	to run API use KEY : X-Gateway-Validation-Id in AUTH instead of apiKey for AKS URLs. 
		 if it is api.azeus then use KEY : apiKey 
		 values can be found from smee-config-repo-prod -> particular service
	  2. if any API has cfplatform and its not working that means its migrated to aks. 
		 so replace the cfplatform URL to aks URL for a particular service by going to Argo Cd -> search particular service -> click on pod -> 
		 scroll down and copy the value of chartis/app-url and replace the cfplatform url domain only.

7. If project requires environment variable to be added in Run configurations of intellij to build or run the project then add it like below for jfrog
	SAAS_ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME=jmohamm;
	SAAS_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=abcdefg;
	systemProp.gradle.wrapperPassword=abcdefg;
	JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD=ah13ydmuw;
	systemProp.gradle.wrapperUser=jmohamm
	

8. {"@timestamp":"2025-02-06T15:14:19.8579339+05:30","@version":"1","message":"Exception encountered during context initialization - cancelling refresh attempt:
