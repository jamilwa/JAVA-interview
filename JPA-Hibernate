1. What is Hibernate?

Answer:
Hibernate is a Java-based ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that maps Java objects to relational database tables. It eliminates most JDBC boilerplate code and automates CRUD operations.

2. What is JPA?

Answer:
JPA (Java Persistence API) is a standard specification for object-relational mapping in Java. It defines interfaces and annotations for persisting data, but it alone doesn’t implement these behaviors; Hibernate is one of the most common JPA providers.

3. What’s the difference between JPA and Hibernate?

Answer:

JPA: A specification/API defining how ORM should work.

Hibernate: A concrete implementation of JPA that adds additional features like caching, better query handling, advanced mapping strategies, etc.

4. What are advantages of using Hibernate?

Answer:

Eliminates JDBC boilerplate

Provides HQL (object-oriented query language)

Caching support

Database independence

Automatic transaction & session management

5. What is ORM?

Answer:
ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping — it converts Java objects to database tables and vice versa, so developers work with objects rather than SQL, reducing manual syntax and errors.

6. Difference between Hibernate and JDBC?

Answer:

JDBC requires manual SQL and result-set mapping.

Hibernate abstracts this via ORM and manages entity states, caching, and transactions automatically.

7. What is HQL?

Answer:
Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language similar to SQL but works with object entities and their properties instead of tables and columns.

8. What are EntityManager and Session?

Answer:

EntityManager (JPA): Standard interface to interact with persistence context.

Session (Hibernate): Similar to EntityManager, but specific to Hibernate and has additional methods like save(), saveOrUpdate() etc.

9. Difference between persist() and save()?

Answer:

persist() (JPA): Makes entity managed but doesn’t return primary key.

save() (Hibernate): Persists entity and returns generated ID.

10. What is the difference between get() and load() in Hibernate?

Answer:

get(): Eagerly fetches the object; returns null if not found.

load(): Lazily fetches; returns a proxy object and throws an exception if entity doesn’t exist when accessed.

11. What are the states of a JPA entity?

Answer:

Transient: Not associated with persistence context

Persistent: Tracked by the context

Detached: Was persistent but no longer tracked (e.g., after session close)

12. How is inheritance mapped in Hibernate?

Answer:
Hibernate supports:

SINGLE_TABLE – maps entire hierarchy into one table

TABLE_PER_CLASS – each class gets its own table

JOINED – parent and child in separate tables linked by keys

13. How do you define relationships in JPA/Hibernate?

Answer:

@OneToOne – single entity to single entity

@OneToMany, @ManyToOne – one parent to multiple children

@ManyToMany – many ↔ many
These are mapped with annotations and often combined with @JoinColumn or @JoinTable.

14. What is caching in Hibernate?

Answer:

First-level cache: Provided by default within a session.

Second-level cache: Shared cache across sessions that improves performance.

15. What are common JPA annotations?

Answer:

@Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue

@Column, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, etc.
These help define entity mapping and relationships.

16. How do you run native SQL in JPA?

Answer:
Use EntityManager.createNativeQuery() or @NamedNativeQuery to execute raw SQL directly.

17. What is a Criteria Query?

Answer:
A type-safe, programmatic way to build queries in JPA (alternative to JPQL strings). It supports dynamic query composition.

18. How is transaction managed in JPA?

Answer:
With EntityTransaction (begin, commit, rollback) via EntityManager, or using @Transactional in Spring for declarative transactions.

📌 Tips for Interviews

Always clarify whether the question is about JPA specification, Hibernate implementation, or Spring Data JPA — they are related but different.

Be ready to explain how lazy loading and fetch types impact performance and how caching works.

If you want, I can also provide a set of advanced Hibernate/JPA interview questions with detailed example code answers! (Useful for 3–5+ years roles.)
