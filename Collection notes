1. What is the Collection framework in Java?
Collection Framework is a grouping of classes and interfaces that is used to store and manage the objects.

2. Distinguish between ArrayList and Vector in the Java collection framework.

    ArrayList	                                  Vector
ArrayList is cannot be synchronized.	      Vector can be is synchronized (only one thread at a time can access the code)
It is fast                                    It is slow.      
ArrayList is not thread-safe.	              Vector is a thread-safe.
It can increase its size by 50%.	          It can increase its size by doubling the size of the array.
It is not a legacy class.	                  It is a legacy class.

3.              Array                                                                          Arraylist 
    Array is static in size.	                                                ArrayList is dynamic in size.
    It is mandatory to provide the size of an array while initializing it       We can create an instance of ArrayList without specifying its size.
    It performs fast in comparison to ArrayList because of fixed size.	        ArrayList is internally uses array. The resize operation in ArrayList slows down the performance.
    can store both objects and primitives type.	                                cant store primitive type. It automatically converts primitive type to object.
    We use for loop or for each loop to iterate over an array.	                We use an iterator to iterate over ArrayList.
    provides a length variable which denotes the length of an array.	        provides the size() method to determine the size of ArrayList.
    can add elements in an array by using the assignment operator.	            the add() method to add elements in the ArrayList.

4. The ArrayList size increases dynamically because whenever the ArrayList class requires to resize then it will create a new array of bigger size and copies all 
    the elements from the old array to the new array. the default capacity of an empty ArrayList is 0 and not 10 in Java 8. Once the first item is added,
    the DEFAULT_CAPACITY which is 10 is then used.
    example
    ArrayList<String> ar = new ArrayList<>()                           // the default size is 0
    ar.add("1")                                                          the size is 1 now.
    
    
3. Differentiate between Iterator and ListIterator

    Iterator	                                                                                ListIterator
The Iterator can traverse the array elements in the forward direction.	            ListIterator can traverse the array elements in backward as well as forward directions.
It can be used in Map, List, and Set.                               	            It can be used in List.
It can perform only remove operation.                                             	It can perform add, remove, and set operation while traversing the collection.
Iterator cannot modify or replace elements                                          can modify or replace an element with the help of set(E e)
Indexes cannot be obtained by using Iterator.                                       nextIndex() and previousIndex() helps to obtain indexes of elements at any time.
Cannot add elements and it throws ConcurrentModificationException                   Can add elements to a collection at any time
methods of Iterator are next(), remove() and hasNext()                              methods of ListIterator are next(), previous(), hasNext(), hasPrevious(), add(E e)


4. Explain override equals() method
The equals method is used to check the similarity between two objects. In case if the programmer wants to check an object based on the property, then it 
needs to be overridden.

5. What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator?

      Comparable	                                                                                             Comparator
Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements in Java.	                Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements in Java.
Comparable interface is present in java.lang package.	                            Comparator interface is present in java. util package.
It provides single sorting sequences.                                           	It provides multiple sorting sequences.
This method can sort the data according to the natural sorting order.           	This method sorts the data according to the customized sorting order.
It affects the original class. i.e., the actual class is altered.                 	It doesnâ€™t affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not altered.


8. What is the difference between Hashmap and Hashtable?

        Hashmap	                                                        Hashtable
It is not synchronized.	                                                It is synchronized.
HashMap allows one key as a null value.                             	HashTable does not allow null values.
Iterator is used to traverse HashMap.	                                Either Iterator or Enumerator is used for traversing a HashTable.
It is fail-fast.	                                                    It is fail-safe.
HashMap perform faster than the HashTable.	                            Hashtable is not much faster as compared to HashMap.
