1. What is the Collection framework in Java?
Collection Framework is a grouping of classes and interfaces that is used to store and manage the objects.

2. Distinguish between ArrayList and Vector in the Java collection framework.

    ArrayList	                                  Vector
ArrayList is cannot be synchronized.	      Vector can be is synchronized.
It is fast                                  It is slow.      
ArrayList is not thread-safe.	              Vector is a thread-safe.
It can increase its size by 50%.	          It can increase its size by doubling the size of the array.
It is not a legacy class.	                  It is a legacy class.

3. Differentiate between Iterator and ListIterator

    Iterator	                                                                                ListIterator
The Iterator can traverse the array elements in the forward direction.	            ListIterator can traverse the array elements in backward as well as forward directions.
It can be used in Queue, List, and Set.                               	            It can be used in List.
It can perform only remove operation.                                             	It can perform add, remove, and set operation while traversing the collection.


4. What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?

    Iterator	                                                                                       Enumeration
The Iterator can traverse both legacies as well as non-legacy elements.	                      Enumeration can traverse only legacy elements.
The Iterator is fail-fast.	                                                                  Enumeration is not fail-fast.
The Iterator is very slow compare to Enumeration.	                                            Enumeration is fast compare to Iterator.
The Iterator can perform remove operation while traversing the collection.	                  The Enumeration can perform only traverse operation on the collection.

5. Explain override equals() method
The equals method is used to check the similarity between two objects. In case if the programmer wants to check an object based on the property, then it needs to be overridden.

6. What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator?

      Comparable	                                                                                             Comparator
Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements in Java.	                Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements in Java.
Comparable interface is present in java.lang package.	                            Comparator interface is present in java. util package.
It provides single sorting sequences.                                           	It provides multiple sorting sequences.
This method can sort the data according to the natural sorting order.           	This method sorts the data according to the customized sorting order.
It affects the original class. i.e., the actual class is altered.                 	It doesnâ€™t affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not altered.
